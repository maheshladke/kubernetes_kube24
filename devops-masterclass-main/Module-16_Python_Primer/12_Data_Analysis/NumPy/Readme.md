# NumPy

## Overview
  - Numpy is a linear algebra library for Python.
  - It is so important to have good understanding around NumPy for Data science is almost all the libraries in PyData ecosystem rely on NumPy somewhere.
  - NumPy is incredibly fast as it has bindings to C libraries.

## Install NumPy
   ```
   # With Anaconda distribution
   conda install numpy

   # With pip
   pip install numpy
   ```
## NumPy Key points
   - NumPy comes in two forms:
     1. Vectors (strictly 1-Dimentional)
     2. Matrices (are 2-Dimentional, however can have 1-D form)

### Lab: Create a NumPy array (1-D) from Python Object(List)
   ```
   import numpy as np

   my_list = [1,2,3]
   arr = np.array(my_list)

   ```

### Lab: Create a NumPy array (2-D) from Python object(List-of-List)
   ```
   
   ```
